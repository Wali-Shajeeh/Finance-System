# Development Plan for Complete Finance System with Invoice Processing

## Overview
- **Goal**: Build a finance system that processes invoices using OCR and NLP, automates financial tasks (e.g., expense categorization, payment scheduling, fraud detection), and provides reporting for freelancing, B2B, or B2C use.
- **Time Commitment**: 3–4 hours/day, 5 days/week.
- **Duration**: ~8 weeks (160–200 hours total).
- **Tools**: Python, Tesseract/Google Cloud Vision (OCR), spaCy/Hugging Face (NLP), scikit-learn/TensorFlow (ML), Flask/Streamlit (UI), SQLite/PostgreSQL (database).
- **Assumptions**: Intermediate Python/ML skills, access to open-source tools or low-cost APIs, synthetic/open invoice datasets.

## Weekly Plan with Ordered Functionalities
### Week 1: Setup and Data Preparation (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up development environment (Python, install libraries: Tesseract, spaCy, scikit-learn, Flask/Streamlit).
  2. Collect or generate data: Download open invoice datasets (e.g., Kaggle, ICDAR 2019) or create synthetic invoices using `reportlab`.
  3. Preprocess data: Organize 50–100 sample invoices (PDF/PNG/JPEG) for testing OCR/NLP.
  4. Research OCR APIs (Tesseract vs. Google Cloud Vision) and select one based on budget/accuracy.
- **Deliverables**: Environment setup, dataset ready (50–100 invoices), OCR tool selected.
- **Hours**: 4 days x 4 hrs + 1 day x 4 hrs for research = 20 hrs.

### Week 2: OCR for Invoice Text Extraction (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement OCR to extract raw text from invoices using Tesseract or Google Cloud Vision.
  2. Add image preprocessing (OpenCV): Noise reduction, contrast adjustment, skew correction.
  3. Test OCR on 20–30 invoices, aiming for ≥90% accuracy on clear images.
  4. Save extracted text to JSON/CSV for further processing.
- **Deliverables**: OCR pipeline, sample JSON/CSV outputs, initial accuracy report.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 3: NLP for Entity Extraction (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement NLP using spaCy or Hugging Face for entity extraction (vendor, invoice number, date, amount, line items).
  2. Create rule-based fallback for common invoice formats (e.g., regex for dates, amounts).
  3. Test on 50 invoices, targeting ≥85% accuracy for entity extraction.
  4. Store extracted data in SQLite/PostgreSQL for structured access.
- **Deliverables**: NLP pipeline, database with extracted entities, accuracy report.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 4: Expense Categorization (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build ML model (e.g., SVM or BERT) to classify expenses (e.g., utilities, supplies, services).
  2. Train model on labeled invoice data (use synthetic labels if needed).
  3. Test categorization on 50 invoices, aiming for ≥90% accuracy.
  4. Integrate categorization into database output.
- **Deliverables**: Expense categorization model, updated database schema, test results.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 5: Payment Scheduling and Fraud Detection (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement payment scheduling using rule-based logic (due dates, payment terms) and basic ML (e.g., time-series forecasting for optimal payment dates).
  2. Develop fraud detection with anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) to flag duplicates or unusual amounts.
  3. Test on 50 invoices, targeting ≥80% precision for fraud detection.
  4. Add flags to database for manual review.
- **Deliverables**: Payment scheduling logic, fraud detection model, flagged invoice reports.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 6: Financial Reporting and Cash Flow Forecasting (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create financial reports (e.g., monthly expense summaries, vendor spend) using extracted data.
  2. Implement cash flow forecasting with time-series models (e.g., ARIMA or LSTM) using invoice due dates and payment history.
  3. Test forecasting accuracy on synthetic payment data (±3 days error).
  4. Generate sample reports in JSON/CSV.
- **Deliverables**: Report generation scripts, cash flow forecasting model, sample reports.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 7: Web App/UI Development (20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build a web app (Streamlit or Flask) for uploading invoices, viewing extracted data, and displaying reports.
  2. Add error correction interface for users to adjust OCR/NLP outputs.
  3. Include basic visualizations (e.g., expense category pie chart, cash flow trends).
  4. Test UI with 10–20 invoices for usability.
- **Deliverables**: Functional web app, basic dashboard, usability test results.
- **Hours**: 5 days x 4 hrs = 20 hrs.

### Week 8: Testing, Documentation, and Demo (16–20 hours)
- **Tasks**:
  1. Conduct end-to-end testing on 100 invoices, measuring accuracy (OCR: ≥90%, NLP: ≥85%, categorization: ≥90%, fraud: ≥80%).
  2. Fix bugs and optimize performance (e.g., reduce processing time to ≤10 seconds per invoice).
  3. Write documentation: Setup guide, user manual, API docs (if API included).
  4. Create a demo (video or live app) for portfolio or client pitches.
- **Deliverables**: Final codebase, documentation, demo video/app, test report.
- **Hours**: 4–5 days x 4 hrs = 16–20 hrs.

## Total Effort
- **Duration**: 8 weeks (160–200 hours at 3–4 hrs/day, 5 days/week).
- **Milestones**:
  - Week 2: Working OCR pipeline.
  - Week 4: Functional NLP and categorization.
  - Week 6: Core financial tasks complete.
  - Week 8: Polished system with UI and demo.

## Notes
- **Prioritization**: Start with OCR and NLP for core functionality, then add ML-driven features (categorization, fraud detection, forecasting) for value.
- **Future Enhancements**: Add vendor management, sentiment analysis, or budget optimization (from enhanced version) after initial release.
- **Portfolio**: Use demo and reports to showcase for freelancing or B2B pitches.
- **Resources**: Use open datasets (Kaggle, ICDAR), synthetic data (`reportlab`), and open-source tools to minimize costs.
